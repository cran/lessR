new function regPlot, which produces the Regression plots from the saved
  output of a previous regression run so that the plots can be interspersed
  throughout a knitr document

new function print.outall which, to add to knitr functionality, allows each
  of the pieces produced by Regression to be displayed individually, and is
  called implicitly by simply entering the name of the object
  
new function print.outpiece which, to add to knitr functionality, allows each
  of the paragraphs of output produced by Regression to be displayed individually,
  including in knitr, simply by entering the name of the saved piece, such as
  r$out_estimates if this was run: r <- Regression(Y ~ X1 + X2), and is
  called implicitly by simply entering the name of the object

Regression
  knitr.file option added to automatically generate knitr instructions which,
    when processed, result in an enhanced html, pdf or Word document that

  changed from "blue" to "dodgerblue", which now has 0.25 default
    transparency for bar fill, if the previous "blue" is desired,
    then set with: set(colors="blue")

citations
   use of functions from other contributed packages cited in output 

BarChart, BoxPlot, Histogram, ...
  can specify an entire data frame for analysis with the data parameter
    in addition to the variable parameter (x, usually listed first), 
    e.g., hs(attitude) or hs(data=attitude)

Density, LineChart
  analysis of a data frame or list of multiple variables possible

BarChart
  invisibly returns the frequencies and proportions just as SummaryStats 
    e.g., stats <- BarChart(Y), so stats contains this info
  pre-set transparency level of col.fill.bar applies to bar chart bars
    of a single variable

SummaryStats (and functions that call SummaryStats)
  outliers listed in two groups, those above the high box plot whisker,
    and those below the low box plot whisker, and if more than 25 then
    the intermediate values in a group are not listed
  more appropriate output when there is a frequency of zero on a
    by variable
  an explanatory note provided when computing row or column 
    proportions that result in divide by 0, which displays as NaN
    for "not a number"

label
  can assign a variable label to a variable as well as list the label, so
    labels can be created/modified without reading from an external file

corCFA
  lavaan code for the default maximum likelihood solution with the lavaan
    function cfa generated for the specified measurement model
  content of items by scale listed in the sorted order by loading
  parameter added, labels="only" only lists the variable labels with

Subset
  new parameter: random 
    Specifies the number or proportion of data rows to retain, which
    replaces the dual use of the rows parameter to both perform
    this task and provide a direct specification of the rows of the
    data table to be included/excluded, so now the following work: 
      d <- Subset(c(1,4))  # retain only rows 1 and 4
      d <- Subset(-c(1,4)) # delete only rows 1 and 4

>>>>>> Changes for lessR version 2.9.3 (2013-05-26)} <<<<<<

Note:  The Excel read functionality added in 2.9.2 is removed because it required
    Java, and this additional installation was adding too much complexity
    for users. To retain this functionality, do the following.

  > install.packages("xlsx")     # one time only
  > library(xlsx)                # for each R session to invoke the following
  > d <- read.xlsx(file.choose(), sheetIndex=1)

    This provides for a direct read of an Excel file by browsing for the file.
    To specify a specific path name or URL, replace file.choose() with the
    correct name in quotes.

    The only lost functionality if the above code is implemented is that variable 
    labels cannot be read with an Excel file. To provide for these labels first
    save the Excel file as a csv file.

>>>>>> Changes for lessR version 2.8 (2013-02-01)} <<<<<<

The keepers of CRAN have changed the rules. They no longer
allow a function to automatically direct output to a data table.
They have decided that users should always explicitly specify
the destination of the output file.

What that means for lessR is that any function that outputs a
data table now cannot automatically write that data table to
d or other chosen name. Instead you must now explicitly
assign the output data table name when reading or modifying data,
usually use  d  or  mycor. To do this, use the R assign
notation, <- , which assigns anything on the right side to whatever
is on the left side of the expression.
    > d <- Read()
    > d <- Transform(Y=X/12)     also Subset, Merge, Recode, Sort
    > mycor <- Correlation()
If you do not make this explicit assignment, the function still
works, but the output is dumped at the console instead of sent
to a stored data frame such as d to be available for later analysis.


Other generic changes:

To be consistent with R functions, the data frame option has been changed from dframe to data.  Usually this is not used as the default d is relied upon, but now specify other names with the data option.

Previously the brief option was used inconsistently.  For some functions it lead to a brief output, and for others it suppressed output.  It remains for functions that primarily send output to the console.  For graphics functions and data modification functions, now completely suppress output with quiet=TRUE.

Updates 2.6
-------------

Graphics procedures
  Color themes were enhanced and the terminology for modifying individual
    colors in a specific graph or system-wide with the set function was
    standardized.  'fill' refers to the color of an interior region,
    either of a bar or a circle.  'stroke' refers to a line or outline,
    such as the border of a histogram bar or a plotted point. Also, to
    change a color theme is now only available with function set, as
    are references to transparent colors with trans.fill.bar and 
    trans.fill.pt.

set
  added an orange color theme, which has a black background instead
    of the usual light background, also added dodgerblue and purple
  revised green color theme
  added option ghost to provide transparent bars against a black background
    with no grid lines, which works well with colors such as orange and red
  colors option was getting too complex and was cluttering the options lists
    for the graphics functions, so color theme and transparency only
    available from the set function, but with more extensive options

Read
  default text output to console that describes the data is redesigned
  new parameter lessRdata allows direct reading of built-in data sets
  can read directly from built-in data sets with lessR.data= option

Write
  write any specified data frame, not just the default d
  specify any file name or rely upon the default
  by default write row IDs as part of the written csv file
  the dframe option moved to the end of the parameter list to be
    consistent with Read

Subset
  abbreviation locate added to emphasize locating cases without creating
    a new data frame, where save.dframe is automatically set to FALSE
  can subset on row.names
  criterion for selecting rows, rows, can be an integer or proportion,
    to indicate the number of rows to randomly extract and also to create
    a hold out sample

Recode
  just data for the variables to be recoded are shown before the recode, 
    and just the recoded and any new variables shown after the recode
  a recode is not allowed to be applied to a factor because doing so
    converts the factor to character strings (use factor function instead)

Transform
  transformed data is shown only for variables that have been transformed

Sort
  default saves the sorted data frame written over the input data frame
    without needing to explicitly assign the result to a data frame
  the keep=FALSE option allows the sorted data frame to be written to
    another data frame with the R assignment statement
  random option added to randomly shuffle the rows of data

Help
  the argument for a specific help page no longer needs to be enclosed
    in quotes  
  capitalization of the argument for a specific help page is irrelevant

  density plot with Cohen's d, mean and hypothesized mean

ScatterPlot
  for one variable, dot plot, gray scale outliers displayed in squares
    and diamonds, for potential and actual outliers, respectively

Histogram
  trans.bars option available, analogous to trans.pts for scatter plots

LineChart
  option col.border added to specify the border color of the filled
    polygon under the plotted lines, including the value of "transparent"

BoxPlot
  dotplot option changed to add.points to be consistent with the call
    to the ScatterPlot function for one variable, i.e., a 1-D scatter plot

corCFA
  sum of squares and average residual for each item and total available
  the number of default iterations for communality estimates increased
    from 15 to 25
  an abbreviation called scales added to retain 1's in the diagonal for
    component analysis, that is, the observed scale scores

corEFA
  items by default sorted by their highest factor loading, with an
    option provided to not do this
  min.load option changed to min.loading and this applies to the
    output of the EFA as well as the constructed model for the CFA
  n.fact argument changed to n.factors

data files
  the name of each included data file begins with "data" instead of "dat"

prob.tcut

Transform
  a modified version of the standard R transform function, but by default
    saves the revised data frame to the input data frame and provides
    feedback and information regarding the transformation(s)

Subset
  a modified version of the standard R subset function, but by default
    saves the revised data frame to the input data frame and provides

    confirmatory model is now written in terms of variable names

corScree
  on the graph of the differences of successive eigenvalues, a horizontal
    line is drawn to better highlight the "scree"

Correlation
  now can provide a list of variables from the input data frame instead
    of having to first separately create the subset data frame 
  now non-numeric variables are now automatically deleted from a submitted
    data frame or variable list with the analysis proceeding

Recode
  a list of variables instead of just one variable may now be recoded
  missing data entries may now be recoded to valid values
  specified valid values may now be recoded to missing values

ScatterPlot
  original function Plot, abbreviated plt, was based on R function plot, 
    which did a scatter plot of two variables and also also did a line chart
    for one variable, now only 1 and 2 dimensional scatter plots are done, 
    so function renamed accordingly, where a 1-D scatter plot is a dot plot,
    though Plot is still available as a name

  each help page can now be invoked with a variety of key words, which
    usually include the full and abbreviated names of each function
    described on that help page

    to 50 characters for y-axis and 45 characters for x-axis to fit
  All graphic files can now be saved from the call to the graphic function
    as preceding the function call with an R pdf statement does not work
    due to the customized graphics system that allows the Help window
    to persist across analyses
  Cutoff value to interpret a numeric variable as categorical now called

>>>>>> Changes for lessR version 2.3 (2012-06-10)} <<<<<<

------------
Overview 2.3
------------

Naming Conventions
------------------
All data analysis functions now have two names, a longer, more descriptive name, that
involves uppercase letters, such as Summary Stats, and a short abbreviation, here ss.
Either version is equivalent. The purpose of the uppercase letters is to distinguish
lessR functions from the standard R functions with similar names.  When appropriate,
functions can also have an abbreviation such as brief to indicate a briefer form of
output, here ss.brief.

Color Themes
------------
Using the new set function, the colors options sets the system wide color theme.
The default is "blue" and several other colors are available, including gray scale 
with "gray". The colors option may also applied to any one specific graphic
function call to set the color theme just for that one resulting graph.

Transparency for plotting individual points with Plot is also available with the 
trans.pts option, from 0 to 1, with a 0 being opaque and a 1 being fully 
transparent. The trans.pts option may be set with the set function for all
subsequent analyses, or it may be set for any one specific call to Plot.

Direct Reference of Variable Names (from 2.2)
----------------------------------
lessR defaults the name of the data frame with data read from the Read or rad 
function with d. Now this convention is leveraged by dropping the need for the
R attach function, or by having to include the data frame name and a $ in front of
the variable name, or using the with function. Instead, for each specified variable
name, lessR searches the user's workspace, the global environment, as well as the
data frame d, or the specified data frame name, for the relevant variable.

Variable Labels (from 2.2)
---------------
lessR functions now can access variable labels, which will replace the variable 
names on the axis labels for graphic output, and be displayed adjacent to the 
variable names on text output.  Use the labels function to access the variable
labels for standard R functions.  See help(Read) for directions on how to enter
the variable labels.

Improved Appearance of Graphs
-----------------------------
In addition to the new color themes, the appearance of the graphs has been changed
to print the values along each scale of an axis is a smaller font and a shade of
gray instead of black.


-----------------
New Functions 2.3
-----------------

Model, model
  Function for a linear analysis, which automatically calls the relevant function -- 
    ttest, ANOVA or Regression -- and therefore replaces those functions from the
    user's perspective.

set
  Created as a wrapper for options(colors="xxx") added for graphics routines to
   specify a color theme.
      
to
  Created to generate variable name lists with sequential numbers when reading
    data into R such as from a csv data file.
