>>>>>> Changes for lessR version 3.4.6 (2016-03-27) <<<<<<

-------------
Updates 3.4.6
-------------

BarChart, ScatterPlot, SummaryStats
  a numeric variable with less than n.cat unique values considered
    categorical only for values that are all integer 

BarChart
  addtop is a multiplicative factor for expanding room between
    the highest bar and the top of the plot, instead of additive,
    also a little more space added by default for 1-variable plots
    by setting the default to 0.05 of total height
  addtop now provides a buffer also for horizontal graphs
  prop=TRUE for two variables provides column proportions instead
    of for rows
  for consistency, count.levels now referred to as count.labels

Read
  variable names are checked for invalid characters in text files
    and Excel files, which R does not do 

set
  re-named theme

SummaryStats, BarChart, ScatterPlot
  for 2 variable cross-tab analysis, if there is no p-value because
    the cross-tab table is not well-formed, such as too many 0's, 
    appropriately indicated in the output

ScatterPlot
  trans.fill option added to set trans.fill.pt in the function call,
    can still be set globally from function theme
  if y-values are unique, as in a Cleveland dot plot, default
    transparency level is 0 because no over-plotting, though can be
    set from trans.fill option also
  bubble.power option provides larger bubbles for smaller frequencies and
    allows the user to provide a custom value
  bubble plot applies also to numeric variables
  option kind renamed style
  "off" added as a value of style, that is, do not plot the data values
  stat option added to produce a scatter plot of statistics such as the
    mean of a continuous variable against levels of a categorical value,
    or counts of a categorical variable, instead of the original data
  sort.y added to sort y-values by x-values, for Cleveland dot plot
  when y is set to row.names, y becomes the row names of the data table
  segments.y and segments.x options for line segments from axis to points

theme
  new name for set
  for default gray theme, base color for point fill and stroke is darker


---------------
Bug Fixes 3.4.6
---------------

BarChart
  stats for two variables prop (proportion) option works
  beside=TRUE, values properly labeled on x-axis

ScatterPlot
  a factor with more levels than unique values displays properly
  large values of frequencies display properly
  by legend displays properly with black background colors
  extreme outlier points plotted with ellipse

  long variable labels printed on graphs with full text, made
    multi-line and also size shrunk if needed to fit
  xlab and ylab arguments also printed multi-line, size shrunk if needed
  variable name pre-pended to the displayed variable label
  default tick labels size reduced from 0.85 to 0.75, 
  white space at top of graph reduced if no title
  rotate.values and offset options provided to rotate axis values so as
    to provide more space for the label
  numerical axes value labels all displayed with same number of decimal digits

BarChart
  for two variables, prop=TRUE plots the row proportion cell frequencies,
    which are now also displayed in the text output
  value.labels option added to provide labels other than the existing values

LineChart
  individual runs not displayed by default, use show.runs to display

ScatterPlot
  can specify ellipse level including a vector of values to plot
    multiple ellipses on the same scatter plot
  allows bubble plot for two categorical variables in addition to the
    already categorical x variable, and both x and y numeric for 
    traditional scatter plot or small number of integer values for a
    bubble plot
  if bubble is large enough in a bubble plot, include the frequency
  displays a 1-D bubble plot for a single factor variable
  scatter plot of one variable more narrow and centered in plot window 
  introduces the Bubble Matrix Frequency Plot for Likert-type data in which
    multiple x-variables display a bubble plot of frequencies for the
    responses for multiple variables 
  bubble plot from small number of unique numeric values under user control
    as set with n.cat, default=10 unique values of a variable
  means plot with categorical x-axis, lines of means are darker, points 
    transparent, and the points for means are darker (or lighter)
  summary stats output of stat analysis for each type of scatter plot
  bubble plot displays corresponding counts, controlled by bubble.counts
  labels option added to provide labels other than the existing values for
    non-numeric variables
  fit.line can be set to TRUE without specifying a specific best-fit line,
    which provides a loess best-fit line

Updates 3.4
-----------

error trapping
  more development of lessR error trapping to replace the more cryptic
    R error messages with more understandable messages that also provide
    guidance as how to correct the problem
    of existing lessR explanations and the following additions:
    1. specifying variables to analyze that do not exist in the data table
    2. specifying variables to analyze without having a data table
    3. naming the intended default data table Mydata instead of mydata
    4. calling a data frame in place of a variable in ttest
    5. improperly enclosing a variable name in quotes in a function call
    6. failing to specify a variable to analyze in ttest and ScatterPlot
    7. trying a histogram for a categorical variable
    8. trying a scatter plot with the second variable non-numeric

BarChart
  colors changed for two variable plots, now based on hues generated by
    rainbow_hcl(24,c=38,l=75) from the colorspace package, such that
    when desaturated all colors have the same shade of gray
  proportions option now available for 2 variable plots

    each 30 lines
  scatter plot matrix adjusts the size of the correlation coefficients
    depending on the number of predictors
  better labeling of subsets output to indicate that only the best
    10 models of each number of predictors are considered, when relevant

Read, details
  More concise output
  Hadley Wickham's read_excel function restored for reading Excel files,
    and Read re-interprets the variable types from read_excel so that
    they are equivalent to those from reading other file formats with Read

ttest
  for paired analysis, difference score now computed from subtracting
    first variable from second variable

ScatterPlot
  ellipse option restored, with axes automatically reset to provide for 
    values of the ellipse that exceed the range of values of the data,
    and fill.ellipse color can be specified, usually with partial
    transparency such as rgb(.8,.8,.8,.2)
  correlation analysis restored
  if xy.ticks is FALSE, then axis labels moved closer to the plot
  ellipse option applies to bubble/sunflower plot

  new function that essentially replaces label function, with new
    features of reading a file of variable names and labels separately
    from the Read function, and also from the console

  knitr.file option for automatic construction of markup file
    from the various output segments
  improved formating of summary table
  graphics=FALSE option added


----------------------------
lessR Installation Bug Fixes
----------------------------
Read
  because of potential package dependency problems loading packages 
    with the readxl package function for reading Excel files, went
    back to the gdata package for reading Excel files, which requires
    Perl, which requires a download for Windows computers, and which,
    unfortunately only reads the formatted data not the actual data,
    so first format the Excel data according to the General format
    before reading

ScatterPlot
  because package dependency problems loading packages with the car
    package, the ellipse option from that package is deactivated

Regression
  because package dependency problems loading packages with the car
    package, the scatter.3D option from that package is deactivated

Read
  Hadley Wickam's read_excel function used for reading excel files,
    which does not require Perl, with the character variables from
    read_excel set as factors as with reading other data formats,
    except for the following addition for all formats ...
  Non-numeric character strings with unique values read as class
    character instead of class factor

Regression

    output object
  displayed prediction intervals always contain the smallest interval
    and the largest interval
  PRESS R-squared included in the default output

>>>>>> Changes for lessR version 3.3 (2015-03-19)} <<<<<<

-------------
Updates 3.3
-------------

knitr compatible

Regression, Histogram, SummaryStats
output system redesigned so that now all output is formally returned when
  the corresponding function completes, back to the standard R way of doing
  things in pieces, but here each piece is enhanced with additional features 

new function regPlot, which produces the Regression plots from the saved
  output of a previous regression run so that the plots can be interspersed
  throughout a knitr document

new function print.outall which, to add to knitr functionality, allows each
  of the pieces produced by Regression to be displayed individually, and is
  called implicitly by simply entering the name of the object
  
new function print.outpiece which, to add to knitr functionality, allows each
  of the paragraphs of output produced by Regression to be displayed individually,
  including in knitr, simply by entering the name of the saved piece, such as
  r$out_estimates if this was run: r <- Regression(Y ~ X1 + X2), and is
  called implicitly by simply entering the name of the object

Regression
  knitr.file option added to automatically generate knitr instructions which,
    when processed, result in an enhanced html, pdf or Word document that
    can be called interpretative output, statistical output plus commentary 
  graphics=FALSE option added, mostly for use with the new regPlot
  explain=TRUE now generates the explanation in the knitr instruction file
    instead of the console, and is now the default so reg.explain was removed
  all new components for the saved object, now of class out_all from the
    analysis instead of the object of class lm defined by the R lm function,
    though many components are shared, also includes the knitr instructions
  scatterplot matrix with correlations in the upper triangle now default
  

---------------
Bug Fixes 3.3
---------------

Screen size of subsequent plots not changed after Help()

SummaryStats
  for a by analysis, levels with n=0 do not prevent analysis of all levels

  sequential stream to the plot window 


---------------
Bug Fixes 3.2
---------------

ttest
  line chart for a confidence interval of a mean displays (if requested)
    even if no hypothesized value
  for two groups, line.chart option works reliably for both groups

PieChart
 color gradient for ordered colors from an ordered factor extended to all
    color themes 

col.ticks parameter no longer defined by lessR functions but passed
    directly as an R parameter, which avoids the warning messages

warning messages
  the causes of many warning messages, though benign, were identified and
     removed by reprogramming

    avoid this issue the magnification factors cex and cex.main, for
    the labels and title, are explicitly defined

ScatterPlot
  default 1-dimensional scatter plot is method="overplot"

ttest
  graph for one group extends to large deviant values of mu0 from the data
  brief version includes the margin of error

    then set with: set(colors="blue")

citations
   use of functions from other contributed packages cited in output 

BarChart, BoxPlot, Histogram, ...
  can specify an entire data frame for analysis with the data parameter
    in addition to the variable parameter (x, usually listed first), 
    e.g., hs(attitude) or hs(data=attitude)

Density, LineChart
  analysis of a data frame or list of multiple variables possible

BarChart
  invisibly returns the frequencies and proportions just as SummaryStats 
    e.g., stats <- BarChart(Y), so stats contains this info
  pre-set transparency level of col.fill.bar applies to bar chart bars
    of a single variable

SummaryStats (and functions that call SummaryStats)
  outliers listed in two groups, those above the high box plot whisker,
    and those below the low box plot whisker, and if more than 25 then
    the intermediate values in a group are not listed
  more appropriate output when there is a frequency of zero on a
    by variable
  an explanatory note provided when computing row or column 
    proportions that result in divide by 0, which displays as NaN
    for "not a number"

label
  can assign a variable label to a variable as well as list the label, so
    labels can be created/modified without reading from an external file

corCFA
  lavaan code for the default maximum likelihood solution with the lavaan
    function cfa generated for the specified measurement model
  content of items by scale listed in the sorted order by loading

Subset
  new parameter: random 
    Specifies the number or proportion of data rows to retain, which
    replaces the dual use of the rows parameter to both perform
    this task and provide a direct specification of the rows of the
    data table to be included/excluded, so now the following work: 
      mydata <- Subset(c(1,4))  # retain only rows 1 and 4
      mydata <- Subset(-c(1,4)) # delete only rows 1 and 4

ttest

Correlation
  name of first variable in bivariate correlation now displays correctly





>>>>>> Changes for lessR version 2.9.3 (2013-05-26)} <<<<<<

Note:  The Excel read functionality added in 2.9.2 is removed because it required
    Java, and this additional installation was adding too much complexity
    for users. To retain this functionality, do the following.

  > install.packages("xlsx")     # one time only
  > library(xlsx)                # for each R session to invoke the following
  > mydata <- read.xlsx(file.choose(), sheetIndex=1)

    This provides for a direct read of an Excel file by browsing for the file.
    To specify a specific path name or URL, replace file.choose() with the
    correct name in quotes.

    The only lost functionality if the above code is implemented is that variable 
    labels cannot be read with an Excel file. To provide for these labels first
    save the Excel file as a csv file.

>>>>>> Changes for lessR version 2.8 (2013-02-01)} <<<<<<

The keepers of CRAN have changed the rules. They no longer
allow a function to automatically direct output to a data table.
They have decided that users should always explicitly specify
the destination of the output file.

What that means for lessR is that any function that outputs a
data table now cannot automatically write that data table to
mydata or other chosen name. Instead you must now explicitly
assign the output data table name when reading or modifying data,
usually use  mydata  or  mycor. To do this, use the R assign
notation, <- , which assigns anything on the right side to whatever
is on the left side of the expression.
    > mydata <- Read()
    > mydata <- Transform(Y=X/12)     also Subset, Merge, Recode, Sort
    > mycor <- Correlation()
If you do not make this explicit assignment, the function still
works, but the output is dumped at the console instead of sent
to a stored data frame such as mydata to be available for later analysis.


Other generic changes:

To be consistent with R functions, the data frame option has been changed from dframe to data.  Usually this is not used as the default mydata is relied upon, but now specify other names with the data option.

Previously the brief option was used inconsistently.  For some functions it lead to a brief output, and for others it suppressed output.  It remains for functions that primarily send output to the console.  For graphics functions and data modification functions, now completely suppress output with quiet=TRUE.

>>>>>> Changes for lessR version 2.6 (2012-10-24)} <<<<<<


-------------
Updates 2.6
-------------

Graphics procedures
  Color themes were enhanced and the terminology for modifying individual
    colors in a specific graph or system-wide with the set function was
    standardized.  'fill' refers to the color of an interior region,
    either of a bar or a circle.  'stroke' refers to a line or outline,
    such as the border of a histogram bar or a plotted point. Also, to
    change a color theme is now only available with function set, as
    are references to transparent colors with trans.fill.bar and 
    trans.fill.pt.

set
  added an orange color theme, which has a black background instead
    of the usual light background, also added dodgerblue and purple
  revised green color theme
  added option ghost to provide transparent bars against a black background
    with no grid lines, which works well with colors such as orange and red
  colors option was getting too complex and was cluttering the options lists
    for the graphics functions, so color theme and transparency only
    available from the set function, but with more extensive options

Read
  default text output to console that describes the data is redesigned
  new parameter lessRdata allows direct reading of built-in data sets
  can read directly from built-in data sets with lessR.data= option

Write
  write any specified data frame, not just the default mydata
  specify any file name or rely upon the default
  by default write row IDs as part of the written csv file
  the dframe option moved to the end of the parameter list to be
    consistent with Read

Subset
  abbreviation locate added to emphasize locating cases without creating
    a new data frame, where save.dframe is automatically set to FALSE
  can subset on row.names
  criterion for selecting rows, rows, can be an integer or proportion,
    to indicate the number of rows to randomly extract and also to create
    a hold out sample

Recode
  just data for the variables to be recoded are shown before the recode, 
    and just the recoded and any new variables shown after the recode
  a recode is not allowed to be applied to a factor because doing so
    converts the factor to character strings (use factor function instead)

Transform
  transformed data is shown only for variables that have been transformed

Sort
  default saves the sorted data frame written over the input data frame
    without needing to explicitly assign the result to a data frame
  the keep=FALSE option allows the sorted data frame to be written to
    another data frame with the R assignment statement
  random option added to randomly shuffle the rows of data

Help
  the argument for a specific help page no longer needs to be enclosed
    in quotes

  density plot with Cohen's d, mean and hypothesized mean

ScatterPlot
  for one variable, dot plot, gray scale outliers displayed in squares
    and diamonds, for potential and actual outliers, respectively

Histogram
  trans.bars option available, analogous to trans.pts for scatter plots

LineChart
  option col.border added to specify the border color of the filled
    polygon under the plotted lines, including the value of "transparent"

BoxPlot
  dotplot option changed to add.points to be consistent with the call
    to the ScatterPlot function for one variable, i.e., a 1-D scatter plot

corCFA
  sum of squares and average residual for each item and total available
  the number of default iterations for communality estimates increased
    from 15 to 25
  an abbreviation called scales added to retain 1's in the diagonal for
    component analysis, that is, the observed scale scores

corEFA
  items by default sorted by their highest factor loading, with an
    option provided to not do this
  min.load option changed to min.loading and this applies to the
    output of the EFA as well as the constructed model for the CFA
  n.fact argument changed to n.factors

data files
  the name of each included data file begins with "data" instead of "dat"

prob.tcut
  renamed from qnt.t, t-cutoff probability function with t and normal curves

New Functions 2.5
-------------------

Sort
  sorts the rows of a data frame by the values of specified variables for
    both numeric variables as well as factors

  a modified version of the standard R transform function, but by default
    saves the revised data frame to the input data frame and provides
    feedback and information regarding the transformation(s)

Subset

    position in the correlation matrix

corEFA
  to match the change in specifying variables in corCFA, the derived
    confirmatory model is now written in terms of variable names

corScree
  on the graph of the differences of successive eigenvalues, a horizontal
    line is drawn to better highlight the "scree"

Correlation
  now can provide a list of variables from the input data frame instead
    of having to first separately create the subset data frame 
  now non-numeric variables are now automatically deleted from a submitted
    data frame or variable list with the analysis proceeding

Recode
  a list of variables instead of just one variable may now be recoded
  missing data entries may now be recoded to valid values
  specified valid values may now be recoded to missing values

ScatterPlot
  original function Plot, abbreviated plt, was based on R function plot, 
    which did a scatter plot of two variables and also also did a line chart
    for one variable, now only 1 and 2 dimensional scatter plots are done, 
    so function renamed accordingly, where a 1-D scatter plot is a dot plot,
    though Plot is still available as a name

Help
  each help page can now be invoked with a variety of key words, which
    usually include the full and abbreviated names of each function
    described on that help page


---------------
Bug Fixes 2.5

    as preceding the function call with an R pdf statement does not work
    due to the customized graphics system that allows the Help window
    to persist across analyses

  color theme for a single variable now properly displays





>>>>>> Changes for lessR version 2.3 (2012-06-10)} <<<<<<

------------
Overview 2.3
------------

Naming Conventions
------------------
All data analysis functions now have two names, a longer, more descriptive name, that
involves uppercase letters, such as Summary Stats, and a short abbreviation, here ss.
Either version is equivalent. The purpose of the uppercase letters is to distinguish
lessR functions from the standard R functions with similar names.  When appropriate,
functions can also have an abbreviation such as brief to indicate a briefer form of
output, here ss.brief.

Color Themes
------------
Using the new set function, the colors options sets the system wide color theme.
The default is "blue" and several other colors are available, including gray scale 
with "gray". The colors option may also applied to any one specific graphic
function call to set the color theme just for that one resulting graph.

Transparency for plotting individual points with Plot is also available with the 
trans.pts option, from 0 to 1, with a 0 being opaque and a 1 being fully 
transparent. The trans.pts option may be set with the set function for all
subsequent analyses, or it may be set for any one specific call to Plot.

Direct Reference of Variable Names (from 2.2)
----------------------------------
lessR defaults the name of the data frame with data read from the Read or rad 
function with mydata. Now this convention is leveraged by dropping the need for the
R attach function, or by having to include the data frame name and a $ in front of
the variable name, or using the with function. Instead, for each specified variable
name, lessR searches the user's workspace, the global environment, as well as the
data frame mydata, or the specified data frame name, for the relevant variable.

Variable Labels (from 2.2)
---------------
lessR functions now can access variable labels, which will replace the variable 
names on the axis labels for graphic output, and be displayed adjacent to the 
variable names on text output.  Use the labels function to access the variable
labels for standard R functions.  See help(Read) for directions on how to enter
the variable labels.

Improved Appearance of Graphs
-----------------------------
In addition to the new color themes, the appearance of the graphs has been changed
to print the values along each scale of an axis is a smaller font and a shade of
gray instead of black.


-----------------
New Functions 2.3
-----------------

Model, model
  Function for a linear analysis, which automatically calls the relevant function -- 
    ttest, ANOVA or Regression -- and therefore replaces those functions from the
    user's perspective.
