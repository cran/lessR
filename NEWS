Update History for Package 'lessR'




>>>>>> Changes for lessR version 2.4 (2012-??-??)} <<<<<<


-------------------
New Functions 2.4
-------------------

Recode
  recode individual values of an integer or factor variable

The following new functions work with a correlation matrix, named
mycor by default, instead of the data matrix from which the correlations 
are computed. Each function that outputs correlations also generates a
heat map of the output matrix.

crCFA
  confirmatory factor analysis and item analysis for multiple indicator
  measurement models from an input correlation matrix

crEFA
  exploratory factor analysis based on R factanal function, though also
  provides for a multiple indicator measurement model based on the
  exploratory analysis and the crCFA code for which to analyze the model

crList
  list the ordinal position of each variable in the input correlation matrix
  to facilitate using the other correlational routines

crProp
  calculate proportionality coefficients from an input correlation matrix,
  used to identify items that are indicators of the same factor

crRead
  read an input correlation, or other square, matrix

crReflect
  reflect specified variables in an input correlation matrix

crReorder
  re-order the specified variables in the input correlation matrix

crScree
  eigenvalue plot and plot of differences of successive eigenvalues to help
  determine the number of factors


-------------
Updates 2.4
-------------

System wide
  Variable labels when applied to axis labels on a graph are now truncated
    to 50 characters for y-axis and 45 characters for x-axis to fit
  All graphic files can now be saved from the call to the graphic function
    as preceding the function call with an R pdf statement does not work
    due to the customized graphics system that allows the Help window
    to persist across analyses
  Cutoff value to interpret a numeric variable as categorical now called
    n.cat instead of ncut, and is implemented system wide with the 
    set function

Correlation
  minimum default number of digits in output correlation matrix is 2
  computed correlation matrix automatically written to mycor
  missing data choices made explicit with parameter miss, pairwise is default
  cell-wise sample size reported for pairwise deletion
  effective sample size for all cells reported for listwise deletion
  heat map added when a correlation matrix is computed

Plot
  provide for a by variable, a grouping variable, for which the points
    are plotted in a different color and/or shape for each value of by

SummaryStats
  IQR added to full version

BarChart
  legend placement option for right margin added to the standard R legend
    locations and is now the default, legend.loc="right.margin"
  legend in right margin accommodates variable labels
  for displayed cross-tabulation table, variable names instead of 
     variable labels used
  for count.names option, no longer needed to place the data frame name
    and a $ in front of the specified variable name
  text.out option added so can be set to FALSE
  when applied to a data frame, individual graphs written to individual files

Histogram
  text.out option added so can be set to FALSE
  when applied to a data frame, individual graphs written to individual files

BoxPlot
  text.out option added so can be set to FALSE
  when applied to a data frame, individual graphs written to individual files

ttest
  graph option added, if FALSE then no graph is produced for two groups

LineChart
  changed name from RunChart to better reflect its more general meaning

Deprecated function names removed
  color.barchart, color.boxplot, color.density, color.hist

Deprecated function names renamed
  sim.CLT to simCLT, sim.CImean to simCImean,
  sim.flips to simFlips, sim.means to simMeans


---------------
Bug Fixes 2.4
---------------

Summary Statistics
  labels for the two variables in a cross-tab no longer switched

to
  remove debug print statement

ttest
  extra null graphic window no longer generated for two groups analysis

BarChart
  left margin on horizontal bar chart was sometimes too large
  color theme for a single variable now properly displays





>>>>>> Changes for lessR version 2.3 (2012-06-10)} <<<<<<

------------
Overview 2.3
------------

Naming Conventions
------------------
All data analysis functions now have two names, a longer, more descriptive name, that
involves uppercase letters, such as Summary Stats, and a short abbreviation, here ss.
Either version is equivalent. The purpose of the uppercase letters is to distinguish
lessR functions from the standard R functions with similar names.  When appropriate,
functions can also have an abbreviation such as brief to indicate a briefer form of
output, here ss.brief.

Color Themes
------------
Using the new set function, the colors options sets the system wide color theme.
The default is "blue" and several other colors are available, including gray scale 
with "gray". The colors option may also applied to any one specific graphic
function call to set the color theme just for that one resulting graph.

Transparency for plotting individual points with Plot is also available with the 
trans.pts option, from 0 to 1, with a 0 being opaque and a 1 being fully 
transparent. The trans.pts option may be set with the set function for all
subsequent analyses, or it may be set for any one specific call to Plot.

Direct Reference of Variable Names (from 2.2)
----------------------------------
lessR defaults the name of the data frame with data read from the Read or rad 
function with mydata. Now this convention is leveraged by dropping the need for the
R attach function, or by having to include the data frame name and a $ in front of
the variable name, or using the with function. Instead, for each specified variable
name, lessR searches the user's workspace, the global environment, as well as the
data frame mydata, or the specified data frame name, for the relevant variable.

Variable Labels (from 2.2)
---------------
lessR functions now can access variable labels, which will replace the variable 
names on the axis labels for graphic output, and be displayed adjacent to the 
variable names on text output.  Use the labels function to access the variable
labels for standard R functions.  See help(Read) for directions on how to enter
the variable labels.

Improved Appearance of Graphs
-----------------------------
In addition to the new color themes, the appearance of the graphs has been changed
to print the values along each scale of an axis is a smaller font and a shade of
gray instead of black.


-----------------
New Functions 2.3
-----------------

Model, model
  Function for a linear analysis, which automatically calls the relevant function -- 
    ttest, ANOVA or Regression -- and therefore replaces those functions from the
    user's perspective.

set
  Created as a wrapper for options(colors="xxx") added for graphics routines to
   specify a color theme.
      
to
  Created to generate variable name lists with sequential numbers when reading
    data into R such as from a csv data file.
