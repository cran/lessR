% Analyze variable relations for regression analysis for a single predictor

`## Relations`

`### Scatter Plot`

How do the variables in the model relate to each other? The correlation`pl` of response variable `Y` with predictor variable`pl` `X` should be relatively high.
The correlation of `Y` with `X` in the training data is $r$ = `r xP(r$cor[2,1],3)`.

Visually summarize the relation between each pair of variables in the model with a scatterplot. Express the numeric variable linear relationships among the variables in the model with their correlations.

`plot.scatter`

%The correlation of `Y` with `X` in the training data is $r$ = `r xP(r$cor[2,1],3)`.
