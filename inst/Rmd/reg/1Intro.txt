`## Introduction`

The variable of primary interest is the _response variable_ `Y``txtY`. The purpose of this analysis is to account for the values of `Y` from the information provided by the values of the _predictor variable`pl`_, `X` `txtX`.

This regression analysis is an example of _supervised machine learning_. In the language of machine learning, refer to the response variable as the _target_ and each predictor variable as a _feature_. The machine learns the relationship between the target `Y` and the feature`pl`  `X` from the analysis of the training data. Express this learning in the form of a regression model.
